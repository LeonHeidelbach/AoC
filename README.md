# Advent of Code

This repo contains all of my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) participations. I intend to use the AoC problems to learn and/or become better at new programming languages, so don't get a heart attack when you see any suboptimal use of language features (I am looking at you expert Rusticians out there ;-)).

## Quickstart Guide

All of my solutions will be self-contained within their respective directory, so
that you can easily build and run them without an exotic setup procedure and/or
build process.

### Rust

To build and run my [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) solutions just do the following:

```terminal
$ cd 2022/day_1
$ cargo run
```
